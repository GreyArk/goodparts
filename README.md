# goodparts

An ESLint Style that only allows JavaScript the Good Parts (*and "Better Parts"*) in your codebase.

> "***perfection*** *is* ***attained*** *not when there is nothing more to add,  
> but when there is* ***nothing more to remove***" ~
[Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint_Exup%C3%A9ry#Quotes)

If you see someone trying to use ***all*** the latest features,
its clear that they are just trying to *look* cool.

> "_**Programs must be written for people to read**, and only incidentally for machines to execute._" ~ Harold Abelson

> "_Any fool can write code that a computer can understand.
**Good programmers write code** that **humans** can
**understand**._" ~ Martin Fowler

The 3 biggest advantages of using `goodparts`:

1.
1. Readability - Fewer (JS) language features means people reading your code
can get to the heart of what it does rather than waste time
trying to understand how its been written.


Highlights from DC's Better Parts Talk:

> "_**The Good Parts** are what's left when you
**remove all the bad parts**_"

> [07:43](https://youtu.be/bo36MrBfTk4?t=7m43s) -
"_**This will save you some day**, if you comply with it..._"  
> [07:47](https://youtu.be/bo36MrBfTk4?t=7m47s) -
"_It's **not just a matter of opinion**, there is a **good reason for everything** that JSLint asks you to do_"  
> [07:50](https://youtu.be/bo36MrBfTk4?t=7m50s) -
"_I'm only **telling you not to use** the tools that are
**unnecessary and dangerous**_"
> [08:39](https://youtu.be/bo36MrBfTk4?t=8m39s) -
"_Eventually, **we want to be writing with one voice**,
we want all of the software we develop in a project to
look as thought it was **developed by the same person**,
and that person is **really smart**_"  
> [09:17](https://youtu.be/bo36MrBfTk4?t=9m17s) -
"_**Keystroking time** is **irrelevant**, so if you're doing
something stupid to shave keystrokes, that's counter-productive._"  
> [09:55](https://youtu.be/bo36MrBfTk4?t=9m55s) -
"_There's a **good reason those features were added
to the language**.
I can tell you reliably, **that is absolutely not true**._"  
> [10:26](https://youtu.be/bo36MrBfTk4?t=10m26s) -
"_Just because a '**foot gun**' is in the language,
**doesn't mean you want to shoot your foot off**_"

## *Why?*

There are *many* places you can go to learn JavaScript,
*unsurprisingly* they *all* claim to teach you the "right way",
and as a *beginner* it's virtually impossible to tell
which *is* the right path because there's a lot of marketing
hype which can easily be mistaken for "fact".

The only way a *beginner* can determine if the source of
learning is good on recommendation of their peers
or failing that "*gut feeling*", neither of which are
a *reliable* measure of quality.

However when you attempt to understand the "*Philosophy*" of

Most people will not look at http://javascript.crockford.com
and think: "*yes, this looks like the place to learn
JavaScript...*" and that's a *shame* because its "*plainness*"
(*lack of pictures or medium-style presentation*)

## (*Frequently Asked*) Questions?

**Q**: If the intention is to use *only* the Good Parts,
why not use **JSLint** and not bother with this tool?  
**A**: the simple answer is **JSLint** (*DC's tool*),
does not allow you to include a project-wide configuration
file, so you need to specify your environment e.g:
`/*jslint node: true */` in *every file*, which gets old fast.
